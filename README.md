We developed a project by using C++ on the Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) platform with gyroscope technology (Motion Sensors, n.d.) at its core, the gameâ€™s character movements are controlled. Through simple tilt or movement, players can execute slashes, stabs, blocks with shields, and more, with each action depleting energy reserves.
